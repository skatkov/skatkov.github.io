Just because something is ‘modern’ or ‘everyone is doing it’, doesn’t always mean that it’s a best possible option. I’ve been wondering for a while — ‘how did people actually lived without showering every day?’, ‘is that possible that dandruff was not such a widespread problem?’, ‘what did people eat before they discovered fire?’ and etc. Some years ago I took on a challenge of raw food diet (for whole 7 months) and recently I started to wonder home people actually lived without a shampoo.

All my life I’ve been fighting with dry-almost-dead-like hair. They've been flourishing with life after couple of days of not washing it, but quickly became greasy a messy soon after that. I went through a lot of conditioners and only one really helped. My latest off the backpack life made it ridiculously complicated to maintain good hair. Mainly because I had to stick with goods from 7/11 and that conditioner was just not there.

I found this ridiculous (at first look) method that promised that I can wash my head with just hot water. But it required to undergo a 6 weeks transition period to break free from shampoo — soda and apple vinegar should help me with that. It seemed like a totally crazy idea at first, but I’ve read up on other people experiences and decided to give it a try. All the science behind this  is laid out perfectly on (http://nopoomethod.com) (it was a main website of reference all along for me). I’ll focus here just on my own experience, so you may want to lookup that website first to get more background.

## Week 1

I'm doing a 'no poo' experiment for a week. Joined the ranks of people who don't use shampoo, replacing it with baked soda and apple vinegar. So far, not much to report besides horrible smell of apple vinegar.

## Week 2
- Hair already became less greasy and less dirty, even after intense sweaty hikes hair doesn't feel as dirty.
- No more dry-feels-like-dead hair after a wash (was a problem for as long as I remember myself)
- Vinegar stinks, really need to make a good effort to wash it off completely from your head.

## Week 3 

- My wife (owner of hair salon in a past) told me that she notices the improvement. She didn’t really believe at first that I was still not using *any*  shampoo.
- After my wife’s compliment, I’ve kinda decided to not use soda/vinegar and just shower my head with hot water -- after 4 days I’ve noticed that my head started itching. It was certainly to early for such a drastic change.
- I’ve decided to drop vinegar and just wash wash with soda to avoid the smell (my wife was complaining). While hair felt my dry, it was not as bad as it was after the shampoo.

After three weeks (from 6 planned) experiment seemed very promising. Even my wife didn’t consider this idea ‘crazy’ and was thinking if she would do the same. 

## Week 4

- I’ve actually came back to using apple vinegar, more and more I used just soda more hair felt ‘drier’.
- I’ve managed to split vinegar use to two stages, just putting it on and washing in it off twice. This helped me avoid hard to wash of smell of from head.

## End of Week 6

I may consider experiment completed - successfully. Method delivered as promised, I’ve managed to break out of vicious shampoo cycle. Even if I can’t switch to washing my head *just with hot water* , doing this with soda and vinegar was much simpler and more costs effective (it was not a huge concern, but still a good benefit to have). I completely removed a need to buy a shampoo and conditioner, saved time on routine I never enjoyed. My hair has become more obedient and started to stick out naturally, so theoretically this approach totally eliminated need for hair gel or wax as well.

### As an end note

So now I’m sitting in a coffee shop almost two month after experiment was finished and trying to sum this up. While the promise of washing my head with *only hot water* is not completely true (at least for now). I should admit that I have zero regrets I’ve tried this. I still wash my head couple of times a month with soda and apple vinegar. But other then that — every two days I wash my head just with hot water, even after intense workouts and hikes that’s enough. There is still a chance that I’m not doing this properly, so there might be a bit more figuring out involved.

But if you have this issue of really greasy hair — I highly recommend to try out No Poo Method. It seems a bit weird and crazy, but all the shampoo industry seems like a overvalued hoax now. I may see how some may have better results from shampoo usage, but it seems that mostly it's not required.
